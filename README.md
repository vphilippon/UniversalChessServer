UniversalChessServer
====================

A universal chess server on which both player and AI can play

State of the project
--------------------
The project is currently being develloped. The basics of the project is a project assignement for one of my university course. You can expect to have something worth looking at by the 2014-04-11 ( Which means, right after the deadline for my project :) )
Once the "school part" is done, the UniversalChessServer madness will be unleashed!
Get your brain ready, either to play yourself or code the most OP chess AI ever made!
